## Blood on the Clocktower - Town Square

The Town Square gives you a place to replicate a real world seating arrangement in a digital format. It includes a timer, if that's something you use.

#### Adding players:
Enter the player's name in the text field and either click the Add Player or press the Enter key. As you add players, the required roles display on the left will update to tell you how many Townsfolk, Outsiders, Minions, and Demons should be in the game based on the player count.

#### Adding Travelers:
Enter the player's name in the text field and click the Add Traveler button.

#### Running a Vote
To run a vote, select the Start Nomination button. This will hide the timer and replace it with the voting clock hands. Click on the player that has been nominated. This will point the red hour hand at the nominee and the blue minute hand at the next clockwise player. To start the vote, press the Start button at the base of the clockhands. The minute hand will begin rotating around the town. You can adjust the rotation speed by changing the Vote Speed slider. To exit the vote system, click the Stop Nomination button.

#### Everything Else:
The Randomize button will randomize the position of the tokens in the seating arrangement.

The Reset button will completely reset everything back to the beginning, removing all tokens.

If you click on a player token, it will switch them to dead and give them a ghost vote. If you click on them again, it will remove the ghost vote. Clicking on them a third time will switch them back to being alive.
